# Code of Conduct (Apps)

## Rules for Apps that connect with IRIS connect

These rules have been formulated for a unified country wide check-in-app and additional systems.
However IRIS connect adheres to a framework of plurality.

## The applications that connect to IRIS connect commit themselves to adhere to the following principles:
* The solution follows the legal obligations, especially corona protection regulations & GDPR (DSGVO). This includes the physical location and third party providers of the servers hosting the app and/or solution.
* The people in charge, legal entities and compaines offering the app and services are publicly known and verifiable (e.g. via videoident)
* IRIS connect must be able to validate your identitiy and your right to represent your organization on the basis of publicly available information. This includes public registers, e.g. commercial register (Handelsregister) or register of associations (Vereinsregister).
* Known security issues are reported asap: security@iris-connect.de
* The solution does not act in bad faith.

Any act of bad faith, security violation, ongoing data breaches, abuse, violation against the code of conduct or request by local authorities might result in the suspension of the connection to IRIS connect.

## We encurage
* a holistic documentation: Complete documentation and transparency of the service and its interfaces, as well as the data to be processed with an explanation of the cryptographic procedures.
* making the solution open source: Publication of the source code of all components of the service, from the smartphone apps to backend services. As solutions might be part of other frameworks such as in a work environment or rely on non disclosureable patents, this is not a strict requirement. However security of solutions can be improved most by independent peer review. As such we strongly suggest to consider this option.
* making the public aware of the solution's simulation: The solution used will always be part of the hygiene concept that has been accepted by the responsible public health authority. Data can broaden the range of possible activities but are only a part in the fight against diseases. They will never be the only counter measure and should be well integrated with other interventions.
* making the service technology agnostic: The service must be operable by all people with different mobile devices.
* responsible data economy: Only data that is absolutely necessary for the operation of the service may be collected. Access to personal data may only be granted to the health authorities in the event of an infection. There must not be a "master key" to access all data.
