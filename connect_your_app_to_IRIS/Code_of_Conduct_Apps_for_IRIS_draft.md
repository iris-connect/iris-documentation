# Code of Conduct (Apps)

## Rules for Apps that connect with IRIS connect

These rules have been formulated for a unified country wide check-in-app and additional systems.
However IRIS connect adheres to a framework of plurality.

## The applications that connect to IRIS connect commit themselves to adhere to the following principles:
* The solution has to be chosen in accordance with the responsible public health authority.
* The solution follows the legal obligations, especially corona protection regulations & GDPR (DSGVO).
* The solution is fully documented. Complete documentation and transparency of the service and its interfaces, as well as the data to be processed with an explanation of the cryptographic procedures.
* The people in charge, legal entities and compaines offering the app and services are publicly known.
* Known security issues are reported asap: security@iris-connect.de
* The solution does not act in bad faith. Any act of bad faith, security vialation, data breach, missusage can result in the suspension of the connection to IRIS connect.

## We encurage
* making the solution open source: Publication of the source code of all components of the service, from the smartphone apps to backend services. As solutions might be part of other frameworks such as in a work environment or rely on non disclosureable patents, this is not a strict requirement. However security of solutions can be improved most by independent peer review. As such we strongly suggest to consider this option.
* making the public aware of the solution's simulation: The solution used will always be part of the hygiene concept that has been accepted by the responsible public health authority. Data can broaden the range of possible activities but are only a part in the fight against diseases. They will never be the only counter measure and should be well integrated with other interventions.
* making the service technology agnostic: The service must be operable by all people with different mobile devices.
* using servers running physically within the European Economic Area (EEA)
* responsible data economy: Only data that is absolutely necessary for the operation of the service may be collected. Access to personal data may only be granted to the health authorities in the event of an infection. There must not be a "master key" to access all data.
