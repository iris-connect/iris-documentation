# Code of Conduct (Apps)

## Rules for Apps that connect with IRIS connect

These rules are based on rules by D64
https://d-64.org/check-in-app/

These rules have been formulated for a unified country wide check-in-app.
However IRIS connect adheres to a framework of plurality: There is a multitude of situations that require the recording of participants or guest lists, so there is a multitude of apps for specific situations, be it sport clubs, schools, kindergarden, care facilities, music groups (orchestras, choirs), churches, gastronomy, construction sites, offices, production sites and many more.

Which solution is to be used, is at the discression of those responsible for the respective venue or gathering. The solution has to be chosen in accordance with the responsible public health authority. The solution used will always be part of the hygiene concept that has been accepted by the responsible public health authority. Data can broaden the range of possible activities but are only a part in the fight against diseases. They will never be the only counter measure and should be well integrated with other interventions.

The applications that connect to IRIS connect commit themselves to adhere to the following principles:

* Whitepaper: Complete documentation and transparency of the service and its interfaces, as well as the data to be processed with an explanation of the cryptographic procedures.
* If possible, open source: Publication of the source code of all components of the service, from the smartphone apps to backend services. As solutions might be part of other frameworks such as in a work environment or rely on non disclosureable patents, this is not a strict requirement. However security of solutions can be improved most by independent peer review. As such we strongly suggest to consider this option.
* Data economy: Only data that is absolutely necessary for the operation of the service may be collected. Access to personal data may only be granted to the health authorities in the event of an infection. There must not be a "master key" to access all data.
* Accessibility: The service must be operable by all people with different mobile devices.
* Server location: All data may only be processed on servers in the EU.
